RBrowserPlugin Known Issues:

1. The plugin crashes in Firefox on Ubuntu when using compiled C code in an R package which calls the INTEGER function. This is due to a symbol conflict with a shared library Firefox depends on. We are working on this issue. For now, if the package is recompiled with USE_RINTERNALS defined it will prevent the crash (this is not a long term solution). As far as we know this only happens in Firefox on Linux.

2. In exLinkedPlot.html, the event handlers sometimes do not get attached to the point, even though the code thinks that the calls to the hover method is succeeding. We are looking into this.

3. The Raphael graphics device is very slow and doesn't have polygons implemented. This will be fixed soon (by writing the graphics device in C, and actually implementing polygons, respectively).
