Found an old but possibly helpful reference here http://markmail.org/message/anr3h4qw2qrzu2ud to someone who was linking
against libxul. This seems to indicate that even if I am linking against libxul I might want to be linking against
other things as well. I'm going to try that and see if a) It will still link without complaining, and b) it resolves any of the issues re loading

Could it be yet more subtleties of the exact order of terms in the linking command?
