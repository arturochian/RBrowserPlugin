set Revaluator.so to be created by linking against the version of libxul.so actaully installed with my xulrunner version (1.9.2.12) instead of the one I built from the (now slightly out of date) code in the hopes that that would allow it to load.

It still didn't for whatever reason. I think the problem may be that its not actually registered as an XPCOM component. Or rather, I know it is not registered, and need to figure out why.
