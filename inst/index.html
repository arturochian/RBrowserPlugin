<h1>RKML</h1>

<p>
The RFirefox framework currently includes both an R package and a Firefox extension. With these two pieces of software, it allows the user to create web pages which contain and can excecute R code. Furthermore, it allows both the R engine and the Javascript engine to be aware of and communicate with eachother.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p> Documentation for RFirefox is largely non-existent. This will change over the coming weeks, but for now see the tests and example webpages which ship with the package (RFirefox/inst/tests/*.html and RFirefox/inst/examples/*.hml, respectively). These should all work and give you a good idea of how to do some of the basic things RFirefox is designed for.

<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>Slides from when I talked about RFirefox and the types of things we can do with it (high level, not much technical detail):
<a href="files/talkslidesneworder.pdf">WNAR 2011</a>
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p> More comprehensive examples of what RFirefox can do are forthcoming. For now see those that ship with the package.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Installation instructions ship with RFirefox, but can also be found below.</p>
<p>
Installation Instructions for: <br />
<a href="files/macInstall.txt">Mac OS X</a> <br />
<a href="files/Installation.txt">Linux</a> <br />
</p>

<h2>Windows Support</h2>
<p> Sorry Windows users, your OS must be at least <b>this tall</b> to ride the ride.</p>
<p> More seriously, Windows support is forthcoming but not available at this time. If anyone successfully installs RFirefox on Windows, please let me know.
</p>
<h2>(Anticipated) Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>Before using RFirefox, please have a glance at the AFAQ <a href="files/AFAQ">here</a>. </p>
<p> If you experience a crash NOT caused by one of the issues listed in the AFAQ, please let me know in as much detail as you can.</p>

<h2>Latest Version</h2>
<p> I plan to keep this page and the Omegahat repository as up to date as possible, but the very latest version (as well as versions for previous versions of Firefox, etc) are available at <a href="http://www.github.com/gmbecker/RFirefox">github</a>
